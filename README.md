This is the official LiveKit Swift client SDK. 

Together with LiveKit [server](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-server), you can easily add real-time video/audio/data capabilities to your iOS or macOS apps.

## Quickstart

### Something Simple with SwiftUI

### Something Simple with UIKit
```swift
import LiveKit
import UIKit

class RoomViewController: UIViewController {

    lazy var room = Room(delegate: self)

    lazy var remoteVideoView: VideoView = {
        let videoView = VideoView()
        view.addSubview(videoView)
        // additional initialization ...
        return videoView
    }()

    lazy var localVideoView: VideoView = {
        let videoView = VideoView()
        view.addSubview(videoView)
        // additional initialization ...
        return videoView
    }()

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        view.backgroundColor = .white

        let url: String = "ws://your_host"
        let token: String = "your_jwt_token"

        room.connect(url, token).then { room in

            // Publish camera & mic
            room.localParticipant?.setCamera(enabled: true)
            room.localParticipant?.setMicrophone(enabled: true)

        }.catch { error in 
            // failed to connect
        }
    }
}

extension RoomViewController: RoomDelegate {

    func room(_ room: Room, localParticipant: LocalParticipant, didPublish publication: LocalTrackPublication) {
        guard let track = publication?.track as? VideoTrack else {
            return
        }
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            localVideoView.track = track
        }
    }
    
    func room(_ room: Room, participant: RemoteParticipant, didSubscribe publication: RemoteTrackPublication, track: Track) {
        guard let track = track as? VideoTrack else {
          return
        }
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            remoteVideoView.track = track
        }
    }
}
```
